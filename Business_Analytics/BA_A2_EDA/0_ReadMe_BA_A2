There are 6 questions to answer.
1. Are there any missing values?
2. Identify the states that have the highest cost of electricity, gas, and water.
3. Are there any states with an imbalance in Sex?
4. Create a new variable that indicates the Total Annual cost that is the sum of the cost of Electricity, Gas, and Water. Which states have the highest total cost?
5. Which state has the oldest, on average, residents?
6. What can you say about the residents of Ohio based on their age, sex, race, and language. Use only the most recent data.

My work is far beyond these questions. I also do some hypotesis testing, data visualization for a much data better understanding. The report is 25 pages long.
